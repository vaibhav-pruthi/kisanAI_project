# ðŸŒ¿ GreenAI: Your Personal Gardening Assistant
GreenAI is an AI-powered gardening assistant designed to empower individuals and small-scale growers in maintaining healthier and more productive plants. Whether you're managing a personal kitchen garden, running a nursery, overseeing a greenhouse or working on a small farm, GreenAI provides smart, accessible solutions tailored to your needs â€” **no sign-up required**.

At its core, GreenAI offers two primary functionalities. Firstly, users can upload images of plant leaves to automatically detect diseases. This feature leverages a deep learning model based on **EfficientNet**, trained on the well-established **PlantVillage** dataset. Once an image is analysed, GreenAI returns detailed information about the detected disease, including its name, symptoms, possible causes and suggested treatments, helping users take timely and effective action.

Second, GreenAI assists in irrigation planning by predicting water requirements based on multiple inputs such as soil type, soil moisture levels and plant type. This predictive system is built using traditional machine learning techniques trained on structured environmental data, enabling more sustainable and efficient water use.

GreenAI is built with simplicity in mind. There's no need to create an account â€” just upload a photo or input your data and get instant insights. The platform is lightweight, intuitive and designed to be usable by anyone, regardless of their level of gardening expertise.
